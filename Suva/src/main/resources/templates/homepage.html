              Only stayed 2 nights but the hotel has
              standard rooms and very clean. All the
              staff from reception to the restaurant were really
              friendly. It is very central and within walking distance
              of all local shops, cafes, and restaurants.
              Kathmandu is a beautiful historic city with lots of
              amazing architecture to view while walking to your destination."</p>

              The room was very spacious, clean, and

              Breakfast was delicious and with many choices; it
              was a very wide buffet spread. The people at the
              reception were very helpful, not just on check-in and checkout,
